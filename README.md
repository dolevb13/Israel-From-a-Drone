# Israel-From-a-Drone

Israel from a drone is a RESTful web-app I developed as my first step in the web development world.
It contains photos of Israel my friend and I took while traveling the country.

The website allows users to:

- Get information about the place where the photo wa taken, including Google Maps location.
- Post their own photos under their username.
- Comment on other photos.
- Signup with username and password.
